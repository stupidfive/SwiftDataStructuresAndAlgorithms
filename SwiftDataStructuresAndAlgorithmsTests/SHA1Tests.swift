SHA-0 is the original version of the 160-bit hash function published in 1993 under the name SHA: it was not adopted by many applications. Published in 1995, SHA-1 is very similar to SHA-0, but alters the original SHA hash specification to correct weaknesses that were unknown to the public at that time. SHA-2, published in 2001, is significantly different from the SHA-1 hash function."), "8ea059cbebc9a733c6a9e9c939296a98810d9ffc")
